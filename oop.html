									<summary>Unit 1</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this first unit, I learned about the basics of object-oriented programming (OOP) and how it fits within other types of programming. I explored the main ideas behind OOP — encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism — and how they help to make code more organised and reusable.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Practical Work:</h6>
										<p>I followed Think Python (Chapter 15) and used the point.py example to practise creating and working with Python classes in PyCharm. I built a simple Point class that stores x and y coordinates and includes a few methods to move the point and display its position. This helped me understand how classes hold both data and behaviour, and how Python uses constructors (__init__) to create new objects.</p>
										<a href="https://github.com/VedranSkvorc/ObjectOrientedProgramming/blob/main/point.py">Code</a>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me understand the core ideas of OOP and how they apply in Python. Writing and testing simple classes made it easier to see how objects make programs more flexible and easier to manage. I also realised how important it is to write code that follows a clear style and structure.</p>

									<summary>Unit 2</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned how to analyse a software problem before writing any code. The focus was on understanding how users (called actors) interact with a system through use cases and how the system behaves internally using state machine diagrams. These diagrams helped me see the bigger picture of how a program should work before starting to build it in Python.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Practical Work:</h6>
										<p>Using the Think Python chapters 16 and 17, along with the example files time1.py and time2.py, I explored how Python handles class functions and methods. I practised creating and updating variables inside a class, understanding how data is shared or kept separate between different instances. I also started working with UML diagrams to describe system behaviour and object states, preparing for more advanced design work later in the module.</p>
										<a href="https://github.com/VedranSkvorc/ObjectOrientedProgramming/blob/main/time.py">Code</a>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me understand why planning a program is just as important as coding it. Creating use case and state machine diagrams made it easier to think about what my program should do and how it should react to different inputs. It also strengthened my understanding of how data moves and changes between different objects in Python.</p>

									<summary>Unit 3</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned about the Unified Modelling Language (UML), a standard way to visually represent how software systems are structured and behave. I explored how UML is used during different stages of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), from analysing requirements to designing and planning a program before any code is written.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Practical Work:</h6>
										<p>I practised creating several types of UML diagrams, such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, and sequence diagrams, using open-source tool draw.io. These helped me describe the relationships between classes, the flow of interactions between objects, and how users interact with the system. This visual approach made it easier to plan how the final Python program would be built later in the module.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me understand how useful UML is for planning software before coding. Creating diagrams gave me a clear picture of how different parts of a system connect and work together. I also learned that good UML diagrams make it easier to communicate ideas with others and to spot problems early in the design process.</p>

									<summary>Unit 4</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned how to turn UML models into working Python code. The focus was on creating detailed class diagrams and then using them as blueprints to build real programs. I also explored other UML diagrams, such as activity diagrams, to understand the flow of actions within a system.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Practical Work:</h6>
										<p>I designed a class diagram to represent a simple system and then implemented it in Python. This helped me understand how UML elements like classes, attributes, and methods map directly to code. By experimenting with different relationships such as inheritance and composition, I could see how design decisions made in a diagram affect how the program behaves in practice.</p>
										<a href="https://github.com/VedranSkvorc/ObjectOrientedProgramming/blob/main/Library.py">Code</a>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me connect design and development. I learned how to use UML as a guide for building real programs and how accurate diagrams can make coding much easier. I also realised that planning with UML before writing code helps avoid mistakes and saves time during implementation.</p>

									<summary>Unit 5</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I explored more advanced object-oriented programming ideas in Python. The main focus was on using constructors to set up objects, creating abstract classes, and understanding how modularity helps make programs easier to maintain and reuse. I also learned about inheritance, aggregation, and composition, and how these relationships connect different parts of a program.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Practical Work:</h6>
										<p>Using Chapter 18 of Think Python and the card.py example, I practised writing Python programs that include constructors and abstract classes. I built a simple card game structure where a Card class defined common features, and subclasses like PlayingCard extended the functionality. Through this, I saw how inheritance supports polymorphism and how composition can be used to combine classes into larger systems. I also gained a clearer understanding of how Python packages and namespaces control variable naming and scope.</p>
										<a href="https://github.com/VedranSkvorc/ObjectOrientedProgramming/blob/main/card.py">Code</a>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me see how inheritance and abstraction make programs more flexible and easier to extend. I also understood how composition allows smaller parts to work together to form a complete system. Overall, this week strengthened my ability to design modular and well-organised Python programs.</p>

									<summary>Unit 6</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned more about how Python uses abstract classes and interfaces to improve the structure and flexibility of programs. I explored how interfaces help different parts of a program work together while keeping the code modular and easy to maintain. The unit also introduced software metrics used to measure how effective and well-designed object-oriented code is.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Practical Work:</h6>
										<p>Using section 19.10 of Think Python, I created a small Python program that applied abstract classes and interfaces. I used the abc module to define an interface-like abstract base class, then implemented subclasses that provided specific behaviour. This helped me understand how interfaces support polymorphism by allowing different classes to share a common set of methods. I also learned about metrics such as cohesion, coupling, and maintainability, which help developers evaluate the quality of object-oriented designs.</p>
										<a href="https://github.com/VedranSkvorc/ObjectOrientedProgramming/blob/main/abs.py">Code</a>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me understand how interfaces and abstract classes make code more organised and reusable. I also learned how to think critically about my code using design metrics, which will help me write cleaner, more efficient programs in future projects.</p>

									<summary>Unit 7</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned about identifying and fixing errors in Python programs and how debugging supports the creation of high-quality code. I explored the different types of errors that can occur, such as syntax, runtime, and logical errors, and how tools like linters can automatically detect problems and improve code consistency. I also studied how data structures help to store, organise, and process data efficiently within object-oriented programs.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Activity:</h6>
										<p>Data structures are an important part of object-oriented programming because they allow objects to manage and interact with collections of data effectively. For example, lists can be used to store groups of related objects, such as a list of Student instances within a Course class. Dictionaries provide a way to link keys and values, which is useful when storing and retrieving object data quickly, such as mapping a student’s ID to their grades. Sets help maintain unique collections, such as keeping track of enrolled courses without duplicates. Together, these structures support modular and flexible code, allowing classes to handle and search through data efficiently.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me understand how debugging and clean code practices improve software quality. I also learned how choosing the right data structure supports object-oriented design by making programs faster, more organised, and easier to maintain.</p>

									<summary>Unit 8</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned how to perform different operations on data structures, focusing on Python sets and their built-in methods. I explored how set operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference can be used to compare and manage collections of data. The unit also introduced linear search techniques, helping me understand how data can be efficiently located within a structure.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Practical Work:</h6>
										<p>For this activity, I reviewed Chapter 5 and Section 17.9 of Think Python to deepen my understanding of recursion and polymorphism. I explored how recursive functions can be used to process data structures like lists and how polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method in unique ways. This helped me see how recursion supports problem-solving in programming and how polymorphism enhances flexibility when working with object-oriented code.</p>

									<summary>Unit 9</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned how to prepare a Python program for distribution and how to test it to ensure quality. I explored the idea of packaging a Python project so it can be shared easily with others, including the use of modules, setup files, and version control. I also learned about the PEP257 convention for documenting code clearly and consistently. The unit introduced different approaches to testing and how testing helps maintain reliability in object-oriented programs.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me understand the importance of both packaging and testing in software development. I learned how good documentation makes code easier to read and maintain, and how automated tests ensure that changes do not break existing features. These practices are essential for producing professional, high quality Python applications.</p>

								<details>
									<summary>Unit 10</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I focused on testing Python code for both functionality and style before it is shared with stakeholders. I learned how to apply unit testing to check that each part of the program works correctly, and how to use tools like pylint to ensure that my code follows proper style conventions. I also explored how clear comments and documentation make code easier for others to understand and use.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit taught me how important it is to test and review code before releasing it. Unit tests confirmed that my program worked as expected, while pylint helped me maintain a clean and consistent style. Documenting and commenting my code made it more user friendly and professional, which is essential when presenting work to clients or stakeholders.</p>

									<summary>Unit 11</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned about how Python manages memory efficiently without the need for pointers, unlike languages such as C. This makes Python code simpler, safer, and easier to maintain. I also explored how the use of design patterns can help organise object-oriented code effectively. Finally, I learned about sustainable code development and how efficient, well-structured programs can reduce computational overhead and environmental impact.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me understand how Python’s memory management simplifies programming and supports more sustainable software design. Learning about design patterns gave me practical tools to structure my code efficiently and build maintainable applications. I also gained a better appreciation of how thoughtful coding practices can reduce complexity and contribute to more responsible software development.</p>
									</div>
								</details>
								<details>
									<summary>Unit 12</summary>
									<div class="artefacts">
										<h6>Overview:</h6>
										<p>In this unit, I learned about the factory design pattern and how it can be used in Python to create objects in a flexible and reusable way. The factory pattern allows a program to generate instances of different classes without directly specifying their exact type. This approach makes code easier to maintain and extend. The unit also explained how multiple design patterns can be used together in a single software project to solve different structural and behavioural problems.</p>
										<br>
										<h6>Reflection:</h6>
										<p>This unit helped me understand how the factory pattern simplifies object creation and improves code flexibility. I also learned that design patterns can complement one another.For example, combining creational and behavioural patterns to handle both object creation and interaction. This knowledge will help me design more efficient and maintainable object-oriented programs.</p>
