                                    <h2>Unit 1: Introduction to Software Engineering Project Management </h2>

                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In this unit, I learned about the role of the Software Engineering Project Manager and how it differs from traditional project management. The unit introduced the need for SEPM by looking at how software projects combine technical, organisational, and people-focused challenges. It also covered the history of project management and software engineering, as well as common tools and certifications used by project managers.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                       This unit helped me understand why managing software projects is different from managing other types of projects. I found it interesting to see how many large projects have failed due to poor planning, communication, or unrealistic expectations. It made me realise that software project management is not just about schedules and budgets, but also about understanding complexity and change.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Unit 2: Study: Why Projects Fail and Gathering Requirements Exercise</h2>

                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit focused on why software projects fail and how better requirements gathering can reduce those failures. I learned about common reasons projects go wrong and explored ways to reduce risk. The unit also introduced requirements gathering using Gherkin as a way to express requirements clearly.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit showed me how important clear requirements are at the start of a project. I learned that many failures happen because requirements are unclear or misunderstood. Using Gherkin helped me see how structured language can reduce ambiguity and improve communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Unit 3: Estimating, Planning and Risk</h2>

                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In this unit, I learned about different tools used by project managers for estimation, planning, and risk assessment. The unit covered various estimating techniques, planning tools, and risk frameworks, and explained how to choose the most appropriate tools for different situations.

                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    This unit helped me understand that estimation is rarely exact and often involves judgement. I realised that project managers must balance accuracy with uncertainty and make decisions based on limited information. Learning about risk assessment also showed me that identifying risks early is an important part of successful project management.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Unit 4: Estimating Tools and Risk Assessment</h2>

                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit built on the previous one by focusing on risks in large software projects and how to manage them. It also involved producing a project estimate using the tools discussed earlier and evaluating how useful those tools were.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I found this unit useful because it showed how estimation and risk management work together. Creating and evaluating estimates helped me see how assumptions affect project plans. It also made me aware that no estimating tool is perfect, and that project managers must constantly review and adjust their plans.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Unit 5: User Experience</h2>

                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit introduced the concept of user experience (UX) and its importance in software development projects. It explored different stakeholders, how UX can be measured, and the role of the project manager in supporting good user experience. The unit also linked UX to testing and development practices.

                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                    This unit changed how I think about user experience. I realised that UX is not just about design, but also about planning, testing, and decision-making throughout the project. Understanding UX as a management concern helped me see how project managers influence how users experience a system.
                                    </p>

                                    <h2>Unit 6: Pytest and Test-Driven Development</h2>

                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In this unit, I worked on a group assignment based on a case study and stakeholder transcript. The task involved extracting requirements, identifying assumptions and gaps, selecting a development approach, and creating a fully costed project plan with milestones and testing stages.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit helped me apply ideas from earlier units in a more realistic scenario. Analysing the transcript showed how unclear stakeholder communication can create uncertainty. Working as a group highlighted the importance of communication and coordination, and helped me better understand the challenges project managers face when planning under constraints.

                                    This unit helped me understand that quality is not just about testing at the end of a project. Learning about technical debt showed me how poor quality decisions can cause long-term problems. I now see quality management as an ongoing responsibility throughout the project.

                                    <h2>Unit 10: Software Quality Monitoring in Python</h2>

                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This unit focused on monitoring software quality using tools such as Python linters. It also explored how the definition of software quality has changed over time and how failed projects can be recovered.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                       This unit showed me that quality should be monitored continuously, not checked once. I found it interesting to see how modern practices build on older quality models. It also helped me understand that project failure does not always mean the project is lost, and that recovery is sometimes possible.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        This unit explored emerging trends in software engineering project management and how they may shape the future of the discipline. It considered the advantages and disadvantages of different trends and their impact on the SEPM role.

                                    This unit encouraged me to think about how project management is evolving. I learned that future project managers will need to balance productivity with wellbeing, collaboration, and sustainability. It helped me see how the role of SEPM may continue to change.

                                    <h2>Unit 12: The Case for the Future Direction of Software Engineering Project Management</h2>

                                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        In this final unit, we evaluated future trends in SEPM and built a case for which trends are most likely to drive future developments. The unit involved discussion and critical evaluation of different ideas.
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                                    <p>
                                       This unit helped me bring together everything I learned during the module. Reflecting on future trends made me think about how the skills learned in this module will remain relevant as technology and project management practices evolve.
